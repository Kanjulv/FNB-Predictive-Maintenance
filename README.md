#  Predictive Operations System for F&B Manufacturing

This project is a real-time, interactive dashboard designed to detect process anomalies in Food & Beverage manufacturing. It was developed as a submission for the [Name of Hackathon]. The system provides a unified "Process Health Score," forecasts the business impact of anomalies, and guides operator actions through an interactive digital playbook, complete with a regulatory-ready audit log.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Unified Health Monitoring:** A real-time "Process Health Score" gauge provides an at-a-glance understanding of the production line's stability.
* **Quality Impact Forecast:** The system forecasts the direct business impact of anomalies, such as projected yield loss or a Cpk drift.
* **Interactive Digital Playbooks:** Upon an alert, operators are guided by an interactive checklist of standard operating procedures (SOPs).
* **Full Audit Trail:** All acknowledged events are logged in a persistent, downloadable report, providing traceability for HACCP and ISO 22000 compliance.
* **Multi-SKU Capability:** The system can dynamically load different process profiles ("Golden Batches") for various products (e.g., Chocolate Chip vs. Oatmeal Raisin cookies).

There are two ways to run this project:

### 1. Self-Contained Demo (Recommended)
This is the quickest way to see the project in action.

1.  Upload the `.ipynb` file (`HoneywellDraft1.ipynb`) to Google Colab.
2.  Run all the cells in order from top to bottom.
3.  The final cell will output a public `ngrok` URL. Click this link to open the live dashboard.

### 2. Local Environment Setup
To run the project on your local machine:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kanjulv/FNB-Predictive-Maintenance
    ```
